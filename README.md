# STOCS 

Stocs is a Ruby on Rails web application using React on the front end. With Stocs, you can search for live and historical stock data of almost every public trading company, as well as create and account to add stocks to your watchlist previews on a private dashboard.

With it, users can freely browse and track their favourite companies to learn about the stock market and investing without any financial risk.

A link to the Live site can be found [here](https://stocs.herokuapp.com/#/)! A demo user can be found in the log in section if you'd like to preview the site without creating an account.
